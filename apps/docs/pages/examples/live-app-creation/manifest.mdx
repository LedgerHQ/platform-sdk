### 9. **Creating a Manifest File**

A manifest file is necessary to test your Live App inside Ledger Live. Create a `manifest.json` file at the root of your project with the following content:

```json
// manifest.json
{
  "id": "YourAppName",
  "name": "YourAppName",
  "url": "http://localhost:3000/",
  // ... [TODO : ADD MISSING ELEMENTS]
}
```

### 10. **Importing Manifest in Ledger Live**

Ensure Ledger Live Desktop is installed on your computer. Enable Developer mode in Ledger Live by navigating to **Settings** -> **About**, and clicking ten times on the Ledger Live version. This will reveal a new **Developer** section in the settings menu.

- Enable **platform dev tools**.
- Click on **Browse** next to **Add a local app** and select the manifest you created.

Now you'll see a new row in the menu with the name of your Live App. You can now open and test your Live App within Ledger Live.
